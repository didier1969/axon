## READ THIS FIRST

You have no prior context. This document tells you everything.

**Project:** axon
**Core value:** Developers and AI agents can instantly understand any codebase — files auto-indexed on change, agents query the DB to reduce token usage and improve response quality.

## Current State

**Version:** 0.2.3 (next will be 0.3.0)
**Phase:** 3 of 3 — Workflow Integration (in progress)
**Plan:** 03-03 complete, 03-04 next (Developer documentation)

**Loop Position:**
```
PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY
  ✓        ✓        ✓     [Loop complete — ready for next PLAN]
```

## What Was Done This Session

### Plan 03-03 — MCP Query API Refinement (planned, applied, unified this session)
- Rewrote all 7 MCP tool descriptions to be agent-actionable (when-to-use, what-it-returns, next-tool chaining)
- `axon_query`: added optional `language` parameter — post-filters results by `SearchResult.language`
- `axon_context`: supports `"path/file.py:symbol_name"` format; returns disambiguation list when bare name matches multiple files
- `SearchResult.language` field added to `base.py`; populated in `fts_search` (KuzuDB Cypher updated) and `vector_search`
- 7 new tests added; **678/678 tests passing** (671 → +7)
- Commit: `8f2788f`

---

## What's Next

**Immediate:** `/paul:plan` for Plan 03-04 — Developer documentation

03-04 scope (from ROADMAP):
- Documentation and onboarding
- README improvements, usage guide
- MCP tool reference (leverages the rewritten descriptions from 03-03)
- Getting-started flow for new users

**After that:** Phase 3 complete → milestone transition to v0.3.0

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.paul/STATE.md` | Live project state — read first |
| `.paul/ROADMAP.md` | Phase overview — 3 of 4 plans done in phase 3 |
| `src/axon/mcp/server.py` | MCP tool definitions (descriptions rewritten in 03-03) |
| `src/axon/mcp/tools.py` | Tool handlers (language filter + disambiguation added in 03-03) |

## Resume Instructions

1. Run `/paul:resume` — reads STATE.md and routes to ONE action
2. The suggested action will be `/paul:plan` (Plan 03-04 — Developer documentation)
3. Before planning 03-04, review `README.md` (or confirm it exists) to understand current doc state
