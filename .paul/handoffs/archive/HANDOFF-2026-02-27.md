## READ THIS FIRST

You have no prior context. This document tells you everything.

**Project:** Axon — Code intelligence knowledge graph for AI agents
**Core value:** Developers and AI agents can instantly understand any codebase — files auto-indexed, agents query the DB to reduce token usage and improve quality.

---

## Current State

**Version:** 0.3.0 (pyproject.toml still says 0.2.3 — needs bump in v0.4 quality plan)
**Milestone:** v0.4 Consolidation & Scale
**Phase:** 1 of 1 — Consolidation & Scale (Planning)
**Plan:** Not started

**Loop Position:**
```
PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY
  ○        ○        ○     [Ready to plan 01-01]
```

---

## What Was Done This Session

- Completed v0.3 milestone (plan 03-04: documentation, README fixes, docs/getting-started.md)
- Full PLAN → APPLY → UNIFY loop for 03-04
- Phase 3 transition: PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md all updated
- Git commits: f96af8f (phase transition), 224def3 (handoff cleanup), 55d3160 (v0.4 milestone)
- Pushed all to origin/main
- Installed Axon globally: `uv tool install --from /home/dstadel/projects/axon axoniq` → `/home/dstadel/.local/bin/axon`
- Configured MCP server in `~/.claude/settings.json` (axon serve --watch)
- Indexed all 25 projects in ~/projects/ with `axon analyze --no-embeddings` (25/25 succeeded)
- Created v0.4 milestone with MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, PROJECT.md

---

## What's In Progress

- Nothing in progress — clean state, ready to start planning

---

## What's Next

**Immediate:** `/paul:plan` for plan 01-01 (Performance optimization)
- Batch Cypher inserts in kuzu_backend.py (928 LOC, largest module)
- Async embeddings (decouple from indexing pipeline)
- Profile the 3 slowest repos: machineflow (562s), flow_analyzer (515s), BookingSystem (474s)

**After that:** 4 more plans in sequence:
- 01-02: Code quality (error handling, kuzu_backend split, version bump 0.2.3→0.4.0)
- 01-03: Markdown parser upgrade (regex→tree-sitter, frontmatter, tables)
- 01-04: New language parsers (Go, YAML/TOML, SQL, HTML/CSS → 10 total)
- 01-05: Multi-repo intelligence (cross-repo MCP queries)

---

## Key Observations

- Indexing times without embeddings: 11s (small) to 562s (large) — perf is the top priority
- `kuzu_backend.py` at 928 LOC is the refactor target
- `except Exception` appears 5+ times in `mcp/tools.py` — silent error swallowing
- Markdown parser is 108 LOC (regex) vs 500+ for other parsers (tree-sitter)
- pyproject.toml version stuck at 0.2.3
- 659 tests total, 678 reported passing in v0.3 (discrepancy may be parametrized tests)
- Deferred: watcher tests slow (~57s), community detection sequential for 100k+ LOC

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.paul/STATE.md` | Live project state |
| `.paul/ROADMAP.md` | Phase overview (v0.3 complete, v0.4 in progress) |
| `.paul/MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md` | Full feature breakdown for v0.4 |
| `.paul/PROJECT.md` | Requirements and decisions |
| `src/axon/core/storage/kuzu_backend.py` | 928 LOC — refactor target |
| `src/axon/mcp/tools.py` | 536 LOC — error handling fixes needed |
| `src/axon/core/parsers/markdown.py` | 108 LOC — upgrade target |

---

## Resume Instructions

1. Read `.paul/STATE.md` for latest position
2. Check loop position (should be ○ ○ ○ — ready to plan)
3. Run `/paul:resume` — it will route to `/paul:plan` for 01-01
