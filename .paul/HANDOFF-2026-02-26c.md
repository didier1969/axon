## READ THIS FIRST

You have no prior context. This document tells you everything.

**Project:** axon
**Core value:** Developers and AI agents can instantly understand any codebase — files auto-indexed on change, agents query the DB to reduce token usage and improve response quality.

---

## Current State

**Version:** 0.2.3 (next will be 0.3.0)
**Phase:** 3 of 3 — Workflow Integration (in progress)
**Plan:** 03-02 complete, 03-03 next (MCP query API refinement)

**Loop Position:**
```
PLAN ──▶ APPLY ──▶ UNIFY
  ✓        ✓        ✓     [Loop complete — ready for next PLAN]
```

## What Was Done This Session

### Plan 03-01 — Shell Integration (unified this session)
- `axon shell-hook [--shell bash|zsh]` — eval-safe auto-start via PROMPT_COMMAND / add-zsh-hook
- `axon init [--direnv]` — idempotent `.envrc` block with PID-file guard
- 16 tests (TestShellHook + TestInit); commit 988c22b

### Plan 03-02 — CI Integration (planned, applied, unified this session)
- `axon dead-code --exit-code` — exits 1 if dead code found; CI quality gate
- `templates/github-actions.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow template
- `templates/pre-commit-config.yaml` — pre-commit hooks template
- 3 new tests in TestDeadCode; commit 7c81a55

**Total tests: 671/671 passing** (668 prior + 3 new)

## What's Next

**Immediate:** `/paul:plan` for Plan 03-03 — MCP query API refinement

03-03 scope (from ROADMAP):
- Refined MCP query API for agent consumption
- Review existing MCP tools (`axon_query`, `axon_context`, `axon_impact`, etc.)
- Identify gaps or improvements in query patterns, response quality, or tool ergonomics
- Consider: result ranking, pagination, structured output formats

**After that:** 03-04 — Developer documentation

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.paul/STATE.md` | Live project state — read first |
| `.paul/ROADMAP.md` | Phase overview — 2 of 4 plans done in phase 3 |
| `src/axon/cli/main.py` | CLI commands (shell-hook, init, dead-code --exit-code added) |
| `src/axon/mcp/tools.py` | MCP tools — next plan (03-03) focuses here |
| `src/axon/mcp/resources.py` | MCP resources — also relevant to 03-03 |
| `templates/` | CI templates added this session |

---

## Resume Instructions

1. Run `/paul:resume` — reads STATE.md and routes to ONE action
2. The suggested action will be `/paul:plan` (Plan 03-03 — MCP query API refinement)
3. Before planning 03-03, explore `src/axon/mcp/tools.py` and `src/axon/mcp/server.py` to understand current MCP surface
