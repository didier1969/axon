# Roadmap: axon

## Overview

Axon evolves from a functional code indexer into a production-grade tool that seamlessly handles any project at any scale. The roadmap prioritises language coverage, large-project performance, and frictionless integration into daily development workflows — making it the default intelligence layer for AI-assisted development.

## Current Milestone

**v0.5 Hardening**
Status: 🚧 In Progress
Phases: 1 of 2 complete

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Completed |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Test Quality & Bug Fixes | 2/2 | ✅ Complete | 2026-02-28 |
| 2 | Parser & Performance | TBD | Not started | - |

### Phase 1: Test Quality & Bug Fixes ✅

Focus: Fix test infrastructure issues and analytics pollution bugs
Plans: 2/2 complete

- ✅ events.jsonl isolated via autouse conftest fixture (plan 01-01)
- ✅ Async embeddings race fixed: future.result() inside patch block (plan 01-02)
- ✅ test_watcher.py: 102s → 28s via session-scoped pre-indexed template (plan 01-02)
- ✅ test_pipeline.py: 166s → 81s via session-scoped schema template (plan 01-02)
- ✅ Watcher aggressiveness hotfix: embeddings now on 60s interval not 30s (plan 01-02)

### Phase 2: Parser & Performance

Focus: Close parser gaps and parallelize graph algorithms
Plans: TBD (defined during /paul:plan)

- Elixir `use` → heritage relationship (currently logs warnings on every Elixir project)
- Community detection parallelization (19% cold-start overhead, currently sequential)

## Next Milestone

TBD after v0.5 complete.
